Due to my fulltime position, i do not have much free time to work on private projects. The project came to birth because one of my relatives asked if i can build them a website for their Business. Now that their project reached its last steps before being deployed i just found it nice to make a modified copy of it. So next to protecting their privacy and Business still the project can be open-source.
